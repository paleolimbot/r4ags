```

## Your Turn 1

Reading an Excel file requires the `read_excel()` function from the _readxl_ package. Load the _readxl_ package below (it is already installed on your computer if you installed the _tidyverse_ package:

```{r}
library(readxl)
```

## Your Turn 2

Use the `read_excel()` function to read the `"warwick.xlsx"` file, and assign it to a variable called `warwick_xl`.

```{r}
warwick_xl <- read_excel("../warwick.xlsx")
```

## Your Turn 3

The following code will read the `"warwick.csv"` file and assign it to the variable `warwick_csv`. Use the output from the command to set the `col_types` argument of `read_csv()`. Did it guess the column types correctly?

```{r}
warwick_csv <- read_csv("../warwick.csv")
```

## Your Turn 4

Use the `View()` function (i.e, click on the object name in the _Environment_ tab of RStudio), the `head()` function, and the `glimpse()` function to examine the three `warwick*` objects. Are they identical to each other?

```{r}
head(warwick)
head(warwick_xl)
head(warwick_csv)

glimpse(warwick)
glimpse(warwick_xl)
```

# Take Aways

- The `read_excel()` function from the _readxl_ package can be used to read excel files as R data frames.
- The `read_csv()` function can be used to import CSV files into R as data frames. Use `col_types = cols(...)` to specify which columns are of which type.
- The `View()`, `head()` and `glimpse()` functions can be used to make sure the data imported properly.
